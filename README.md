# Employee Pay Calculator
The Employee Pay Calculator is an application that allows you to read an employee details file, calculate the weekly pay, tax, and superannuation for an employee, given their hourly rate and hours worked, and save the payslip to a new file, meeting your requirements for a pay calculator application.

This was completed as a project for a Object-Oriented Programming unit at TAFE NSW.
