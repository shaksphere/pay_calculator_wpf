# Employee Pay Calculator
The Employee Pay Calculator is an application that allows you to read an employee details file, calculate the weekly pay, tax, and superannuation for an employee, given their hourly rate and hours worked, and save the payslip to a new file, meeting your requirements for a pay calculator application.

5. Click "Ok" on the dialog box and you will then see a payment summary preview on the right side of the application.
6. Click "Save New Payslip" and you will get a confirmation that the new payslip has been saved.
7. The new CSV payslip file is now available with the employeeâ€™s name and date/time stamp on the file.
